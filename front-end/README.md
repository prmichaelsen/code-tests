# Front End Interview Tests

## Instructions

For each test, consult the appropriate folder. You will need to write some code to make it do the right thing. After you are done with the test the interviewer will review the results with you.

## Test 1: Map Searching

Look in `map-search-test/`. Implement the code in `index.html` (and associated `.css` or `.js` files as necessary)
